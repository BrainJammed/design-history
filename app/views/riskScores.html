                <p class="govuk-body">In iteration 1 we had an ideation session (Martin Liddament , Simon Scott, Tim Brazier. Konstantinos Bougioukntolaptsis). We brought different ideas from other areas and sketched our own ones based on the user needs.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">The POVs we used for ideation where:</p>
                  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>As a probation officer I want to see every risk scores in one place because I don't want to click

                    <li>As a probation officer I want to understand the progress of someone's risk because I need to 
                    understnad what has hapened and assess them properly.</li>
                    <li>As a probation officer I want to see information about each actuarial score beause I need to refresh my memory of what each one is looking at and what it means.</li>

          <p class="govuk-body">In the first page we see the dashboard where the individual's risk scores are displayed all in one place. The arrows next to the scores indicate the trajectory of the score. A timeline under the scores shows the assessment history of the individual. When we click to a score we deep dive into details about it.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body"> In page 2 we see the OGRS3 detailed view. There is a score line with the current score displayed there. At the top of the page there is information about what this score is about. At the bottom of the page we see a timeline specifically for that score and a trajectory of it.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">In page 3 we see the detailed view of ROSH. ROSH does not have a score or a scoreline but has a table showing the individual's risk for each category. Again there is information about the score at the top and a timeline at the bottom </p> 

          


          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Testing prototype 1</h3>

          <p class="govuk-body">During testing we tried to understand:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li> how officers are currently using risk scores to do an assessment.</li>
              <li> the mental model they have for each risk score and which one they believe is the most useful. They were asked to put them in an order of importance</li>
              <li>how much they are usigng scores and their personal experience to decide on the assessment</li>
              <li>what they think this prototype shows</li>
              <li>if the prototype would help them with assessments</li>
            </ul>

              <img src="public/images/test1.png" class="imageSmall">

              <li>The <strong>scores timelines</strong> tested well also. It was good for users to see where exactly the scores sits withing the range of the timeline.</li>

              <li></li>

            <p class="govuk-body">Things that didn't test well or were not understood and we will change in the next iteration:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li><strong>Arrows</strong> were not understood so well. Users thought it was a way to expand the risk scores.</li>
              <li>There were <strong>missing risk scores</strong>. Participants said they wanted to see all risk scores on the dashboard.</li>
              <li>The <strong>risk scores names font colour</strong> seemed faded and hard to read</li>
              <li>The <strong>risk scores guidelines</strong> were taking a significant part of the screen and we wanted users to focus their attention more on the score line</li>
              <li>The <strong>ROSH risk table</strong> was not easy to read and the arrows were misleading.</li>

            <p class="govuk-body">In iteration 2 we brought the feedback from the session to analysis to understand how participants feel about risk scores, how they are currently using them for assessments, what their painpoints are, what do they make of the prototype and what we need to change for the next round of testing.</p>
